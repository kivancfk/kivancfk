### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ I am currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science at Middle East Technical University, with a particular interest in data science, machine learning, and cybersecurity.
  
- ðŸŒ± I completed an intensive Data Science internship program organized by Kodluyoruz & Patika Dev in July 2022, where I gained hands-on experience with data analysis, machine learning algorithms, and data visualization techniques.
  
- ðŸ‘¯ I am actively seeking collaboration opportunities on projects related to data science, with a focus on solving real-world problems through advanced analytics and machine learning solutions. I am eager to apply my skills in Python, R, SQL, and related technologies to contribute to meaningful research and practical applications.
